- Word Lists component has repetitive code where two tables are created next to each other. 
Make it so that the table becomes its own component that can be resued twice within the WordLists component

- fix edge case where the same word gets generated twice and attempted to be added to the same list in app.jsx

- as js docs to the rest of the components
